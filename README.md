Hello there,

Thank you for visiting my GitHub. I have designed a fictional relational database management system for a small dog boarding business. Using Oracle Live I was able to execute the SQL statements and queries to explore data conveniently. All of the data in the tables was created by me. Each of these tables include a user creation date as well as a user updated date to show my most recent work. The Schema folder represents the six tables in the database using the create table statement. 
The Query folder displays my knowledge with SQL and my abilities to fetch data as needed. The Statements folder shows all data that was input, this includes updated data as well. In the Wiki tab you will find a Entity Relationship Diagram model that shows the relationships within my system. The ERD also shows the different type of attributes and relationship instances within my tables. 
Attribute meaning: 
Bold and underlined = Primary Key
Bold and italicized = Foreign Key
“( )” =composite
“ { }” = multivalued
“[ ]” = Derived

I began working on this project in May 2022. It is still being developed as I learn and grow more familiar with Standard Query Language.
