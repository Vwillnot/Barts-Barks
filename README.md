Hello there,


Thank you for visiting my GitHub. I have designed a fictional relational database management system for a small dog boarding business called Bart's Barks. This database management system can be useful for a small business by providing better data utilization opportunities. 
Organizing, storing, and creating trackable data benefits businesses by allowing them to better understand their needs, as well as the needs of the customers they serve. These benefits are essential in assisting a company’s understanding of inventory management, which aids in decision making. 
For Bart’s Barks, we would implement this system in order to determine how much revenue they are making monthly, if the business needs to hire more vets, or if they need to create extra rooms for new dogs. This could also be helpful if Bart’s need to cut back on hiring vets and focus on the dogs they currently have. 

All the data in the tables were created by me. Using Oracle Live, I was able to execute the Standard Query Language (SQL) statements and queries to explore data conveniently. 
Each of these tables include a user creation date as well as a user updated data to show my most recent work. The Schema folder represents the six tables in the database using the create table statement. The Query folder displays my knowledge with SQL and my abilities to fetch data as needed. The Statements folder shows all data that was input, including updated data. 


In the Wiki tab you will find an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) model that shows the relationships within my system. The ERD also shows the different types of attributes and relationship instances within my tables. I began working on this project in May 2022. It is still being developed as I learn and grow more familiar with Standard Query Language (SQL).
